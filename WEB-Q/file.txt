HTTP defines a set of **request methods**to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.

`[GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET)`

The `GET` method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using `GET` should only retrieve data.

`[HEAD](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD)`

The `HEAD` method asks for a response identical to a `GET` request, but without the response body.

`[POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST)`

The `POST` method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

`[PUT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT)`

The `PUT` method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

`[DELETE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE)`

The `DELETE` method deletes the specified resource.

`[CONNECT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/CONNECT)`

The `CONNECT` method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.

`[OPTIONS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/OPTIONS)`

The `OPTIONS` method describes the communication options for the target resource.

`[TRACE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/TRACE)`

The `TRACE` method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.

`[PATCH](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PATCH)`

The `PATCH` method applies partial modifications to a resource.
